# 3sc-test
Pokeapi Front-End for 3SC test.

The solution developed was relatively basic and used vanilla js with Boostrap 4 and jQuery. However, I would be more than happy to redesign
a solution using a framework like Vue.js or React with Redux after my exams have finished.

For the current solution:  
-Click on a pokemon to view their stats  
-Click on the Pokemon logo in the top left corner to browse through pokemons  
-Use the next and prev buttons to browse through pokemon  
-Click on the favourites link the top right to display pokemons you have favourited  
-Click on the heart icon when viewing a pokemon to add them to your favourites  
-Click the compare link in the top right to toggle in and out of compare mode  
-Clik on multiple pokemon once in compare mode to select them  
-Click on the Compare Selected Pokemons text in order to view the stats of the selected pokemon side by side
